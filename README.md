**Sentiment Analysis with Transformer Models**  
**Project Overview**  
This project explores the use of transformer-based language models for sentiment analysis of text data. The primary dataset utilized is the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset.  
  
I am using online documentation for the foundation, Google Gemini to act as a teacher and break down the process into easy to follow steps,  
Claude2.1 is helping me analyze my code/comments to make sure I'm on the right track and helping me with basic syntax errors.  
  
Utilizing free online AI tools has allowed me to adapt to this new technology much faster than traditional learning methods.  
AI is like a calculator, you can use it to speed up the repetitive work, but you still need a solid foundation to know how to structure code, debug, and optimize performance, AI provides a great foundation to build off of.  
**Technologies**  
  
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
