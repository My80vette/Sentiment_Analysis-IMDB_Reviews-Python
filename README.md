**Sentiment Analysis with Transformer Models**  
**Project Overview**  
This project explores the use of transformer-based language models for sentiment analysis of text data. The primary dataset utilized is the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset.

**Technologies**  

Python
TensorFlow / Keras
Hugging Face Transformers
NumPy
Pandas
Key Steps

**Dataset Preparation:**  

Loaded the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset using tensorflow_datasets.  
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing with text tokenization.  
**Model Selection**  

Chose a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., DistilBERT) from the Hugging Face model hub.  
Fine-Tuning:  

Added a classification layer on top of the transformer model.  
Fine-tuned the model for sentiment analysis using TensorFlow/Keras.  
**Evaluation**  

Calculated performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
Experimented with hyperparameters and possible data augmentation to improve results.  
**Challenges and Learnings**
